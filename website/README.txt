This folder is where all the website files, including database, php, html, and css should be stored. 
Any reference material not used to make the website actually function should be placed in a folder under the reference folder.

web pages (usually end in .php or .html) should be placed directly in this folder (website). db, css, and js should all be placed in corresponding folders.
